==================================================
Welcome to eRCA for Weather Radar's Documentation!
==================================================

This is the documentation for the extension of the relative calibration adjustment (eRCA) technique for weather radar.

.. note::

    The eRCA for Weather Radar toolkit contains several files that can and should be adjusted for your particular radar and site needs! Currently, these files are set to work with a handful of ARM radars. The toolkit is not designed to work with ARM radar datasets exclusively, so we encourage you to adjust these files as needed to your radar datatsets, whether they're from S, C, X, or Ka-band frequencies.
   
    While our hope is that the eRCA for Weather Radar toolkit can work with any radar dataset, there are sure to be bugs and kinks along the way when trying out new and different datasets. Please don't hesitate to contact us with issues, suggestions, or useful additions to strengthen the toolkit for the rest of the radar community!
